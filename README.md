## "It's too complicated for me as a non-programmer" 😓

Alternatively, you can skip all these steps and simply copy all the code from the <a href="https://github.com/ProfessionalCatSummoner/Statistical-Quality-Control-Exam-Assist-Program/blob/main/statistical_quality_control.py">statistical_quality_control.py</a> file in this repository. Then, paste the code into a Python 3 interpreter like Visual Studio Code or any other IDE that supports Python 3 and those libraries.

## "It's still too complicated for me! (The echoes of anxiety intensify)" 😣
